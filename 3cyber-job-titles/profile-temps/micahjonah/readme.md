## 👋 About Me  

Hi, I’m **Micah Jonah** — an **IT Consultant** and **Cybersecurity & Networking Teaching Assistant** passionate about helping others understand and harness technology.  
My work sits at the intersection of **cybersecurity, cloud computing, and network engineering**, where I focus on building secure systems and empowering others to grow their confidence in tech.  

I’ve worn many hats throughout my journey — from orchestrating large-scale **Windows 10 migrations** (reducing deployment time by 30%) to supporting enterprise **network and security operations** for small businesses and educational programs.  

I earned **3rd place at the Bloomberg Capture the Flag Hackathon** and built my own cybersecurity lab integrating **Splunk SIEM**, **Suricata IDS**, **pfSense firewall**, and **Kali Linux** for continuous learning and real-world simulations.  

Currently, I serve as a **SOC Analyst and TA**, mentoring students while detecting, analyzing, and responding to security threats. My focus lies in **incident detection, log analysis, and threat mitigation** in both on-prem and cloud environments.
