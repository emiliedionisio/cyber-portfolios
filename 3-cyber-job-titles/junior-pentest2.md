## 👋 About Me  

Driven and detail-oriented **Junior Penetration Tester** with a passion for uncovering vulnerabilities before attackers do.  
I specialize in identifying, exploiting, and documenting security flaws across web applications, networks, and cloud environments — always following ethical hacking principles.  

My hands-on experience includes conducting reconnaissance, performing exploitation using common frameworks, and writing post-exploitation reports that provide actionable remediation guidance. I enjoy breaking systems *to make them stronger* and continuously sharpen my skills through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and lab simulations.  

Currently exploring **advanced exploitation**, **Active Directory attacks**, and **cloud-based pentesting** methodologies. My long-term goal is to become a **Red Team Operator**, focusing on adversary simulation and exploit development.
